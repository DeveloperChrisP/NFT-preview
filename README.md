## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to combine hover & focus states and about background images. I've been reminded that the container needs to be positioned relatively when an absolute positioned item is inside. I've hopefully gotten a little better at coding.
